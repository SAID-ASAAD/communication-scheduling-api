## Features

- **Schedule:** Create new communication notifications for a future date and time.
- **Cancel:** Cancel a previously scheduled notification.
- **Retrieve:** Look up a notification by its unique ID.
- **Observability:** Includes custom metrics via Spring Boot Actuator to monitor request timings.
- **API Documentation:** Interactive API documentation provided by Swagger UI.

## Tech Stack

- **Core:** Java 21, Spring Boot 3, Maven
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (primary), H2 (for tests)
- **API & Documentation:** Spring Web, SpringDoc OpenAPI (Swagger UI)
- **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Observability:** Spring Boot Actuator, Micrometer

## How to Run

You can run this project using Docker Compose (recommended) or locally.

### 1. Running with Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the simplest way to get the entire application stack, including the PostgreSQL database, up and running.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SAID-ASAAD/communication-scheduling-api.git
    cd communication-scheduling-api
    ```

2.  **Build the application JAR:**
    This step compiles the code and creates the executable JAR file that Docker will use.
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3.  **Start the services using Docker Compose:**
    This command will build the application's Docker image and start both the application and database containers.
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 2. Running Locally

This method requires you to have a PostgreSQL instance running separately.

1.  **Clone and build:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SAID-ASAAD/communication-scheduling-api.git
    cd communication-scheduling-api
    mvn clean install
    ```

2.  **Configure the database:**
    Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running. You may need to update the database connection details in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
